                    by Van Levy, accessible at www.vanlevy.com, and how we use it.

                <h5>Data Collection</h5>
                <h6>and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h6>
                <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
                    In order to have an account on this site, you <em>must</em> provide a <strong>username</strong>
                    (which does not need to be your real name) and an <strong>email</strong>.
                    That's it for the required things.  You may, if you choose, add to your profile the following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>your real name</li>
                    <li>your location</li>
                    <li>anything you choose to divulge in an "About Me" section</li>
                    <li>anything you choose to divulge in a "Gaming Interests" section</li>
                    <li>links to pictures</li>
                </ul>
                <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
                    But, to be honest, you could put <em>anything</em> in those fields.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
                    What follows is a string of words that I hope explains to you any of the GDPR stuff.
                    <span style="font-size: 0.75em;">(TBH, we're not certain we understand it, but hey, this stuff is
                        really here to make lawyers happy.)</span>
                    We have taken the basic language from <br>
                    https://gdprprivacynotice.com/ .  <br>
                    With a name like that, we expect <span style="font-size: 0.75em;">(hope)</span> they know what
                    this stuff means.
